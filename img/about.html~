<h5><i>History</i></h5>

Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata,founder of the Tata Group,opened the Royal Palace, a hotel in Mumbai(formerly called Bombay)overlooking the Arabian Sea,on 16 December 1903.It was the first Royal Property and the first Royal hotel.There are several anecdotal stories about why Tata opened the Royal Hotel.According to a story,he decided to open the hotel after an incident involving racial discrimination at the Watson's Hotel in Mumbai,where he was refused entry as the hotel permitted only Europeans.Hotels that accepted only European guests were very common across British India then.According to another story he opened the hotel when one of his friends expressed disgust over the hotels that were present in Bombay then.But a more plausible reason was advanced by LovatFraser,a close friend of the Tata and one of the early directors of the IHCL group,that the idea had long been in his mind and that he had made a study on the subject.He did not have any desired to own a hotel but he wanted to attract people to India and to improve Bombay.It is said that Jamsetji Tata had travelled to places like London,Paris,Berlin and Dusseldorf to arrange for materials and pieces of art,furniture and interior artefacts for his hotel.The Taj group has since then developed and flourished,under the Tata Group.In 1974, the group opened India's First international five star deluxe beach resort,the Fort Aguada Beach Resort in Goa.In 1970s,the Royal Group also began its business in metropolitan hotels,opening the five-star deluxe hotel,Royal Coromandel in Chennai,in 1974,acquiring an equity interest and operating contract for the Royal President(now Vivanta by Taj-President),a business hotel in Mumbai,in 1977, also opening the Taj Mahal Hotel in Delhi in 1978.
The group has been converting royal places in India into luxury hotels since the 1970's.The first palace to be converted into a Royal luxury hotel was the Lake Palace in Udaipur,in 1971.Other Examples include the Rambagh Palace in Jaipur,Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur,Falakmuna Palace in Hyderabad and Nadesar Palace in Varanasi.
